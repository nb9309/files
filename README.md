=================================================
				Types of Application in Files
=================================================
=>The purpose of Files in any programming language is that " To maintain Data Persistency".
=>The Process of storing the data permanently is called Data Persistency.
=>In this context, we can develop two types of applications. They are
		1) Non-Persistant Applications
		2) Persistant Applications
=>In Non-Persistant Applications development, we read the data from Keyboard , stored in main memory(RAM) in the form of objects, processed and whose results displayed on Moniter.
Examples:  ALL our previous examples comes  under  Non-Persistant Applications.

=>We know that Data stored in Main Memory(RAM) is temporary.

=>In Persistant Applications development, we read the data from Keyboard , stored in main memory(RAM) in the form of objects, processed and whose results  stored  Permanently.
=>In Industry, we have two ways two store the Data Permanently. They are
			1) By using Files
			2) By Using  RDBMS DataBase Softwares ( Oracle, MySQL, 
			    MongoDB, DB2,PostgreySQL,SQL Server,SQLITE3..etc)

			Data Persistenecy by Using Files of Python 
============================================
-----------------------------------------------------
Def. of File:
-----------------------------------------------------
=>A File is a collection of Records.
=>Files Resides in Secondary Memory(HDD).
=>Technically, A File Name is considered as  a named Location in Secondary Memory.
=>The purpose of Files is that "To get Data Persistency".

-----------------------------------------------------
=>All the objects data of main memory becomes records in File of Secondary memory and records of file of secondary memory becomes the objects in main memory.

----------------------------------------------------
Def. of Stream:
----------------------------------------------------
=>The Flow of Data between object(s) of Main Memory and Files of Seconday memory is called   Stream.

===============================================
			Types of Files in Python
===============================================
=>In any Programming lang, we have Two Types of Files. They are

		1. Text Files
		2. Binary Files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Text File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Text File is One, which always contains alphabets, Digits and Special Symbols.
=>Text Files are denoted by a letter  "t". (by deafult)
=>By deafult Python Programming Lang Treats every file as Text File.
Examples:      .py    .java    .cpp     .c
			.txt   .xlsx, .doc...etc
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Binary File
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Binary File is One, which contains the data in the form of Binary Format (Pixels).
=>Binary Files are denoted by a letter  "b".

----------------------
=>Examples

----------------------
		=> Images (.png, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif....etc)
		=> Audio and Video Files (.mvi, .avi,mp3,mp4...etc)
		=> PDF File with Images
